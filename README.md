- Hi, I’m Taryn!
- I'm interested in creating/listening to music, making teas, and studying Japanese culture and language.
- I’m currently learning circuit analysis, linear algebra, and machine learning/neural networks.
- I'm originally from Hawaii.
- I'm a Sophomore in Electrical Engineering (SDS Track).
- I chose my major because I've been interested in EE since elementary school due to its need for constant learning, problem solving, and innovating.
- A fun fact about me is: I can play the piano backwards!
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? More programming languages and how to be a better programmer.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: Free Guy.
